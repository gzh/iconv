Codec.Text.IConv
================

This is a Haskell binding to the iconv() C library function.

The only module exported is Codec.Text.IConv, which provides a single
function:

-- | Convert fromCharset toCharset input output
convert :: String -> String -> Lazy.ByteString -> Lazy.ByteString

where fromCharset and toCharset are the names of the input and output
character set encodings, and input and output are the input and output text
as lazy ByteStrings.

An example program to convert the encoding of an input file, similar to the
iconv program, is given in examples/hiconv.hs

Character set encodings
-----------------------

To see a list of encoding names which are known by your operating system,
run "iconv --list" in a shell. Likely encodings are listed on the libiconv
web page:

  http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/

Availability of iconv()
-----------------------

The iconv(3) function conforms to POSIX.1-2001. It is provided by the GNU C
library:

  http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Character-Set-Handling.html

On systems which do not have a native iconv() implementation you may need to
install libiconv:
